# Who am I ?

I am a research and development engineer, working in the field of Machine Learning. For the past several years, I have been alternatively involved on research topics, such as [difficult open ended learning problems](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=alexandre+pere&searchtype=all&source=header), and on software engineering topics, such as developing [dev-ops tools for researchers](https://runaway.gitlabpages.inria.fr/home). Recently, I joined a [company](https://zama.ai/) to help them tackle the ambitious challenge of bringing encryption to artificial intelligence software; a thrilling experience!

I love learning about new things, which is probably one of the reasons I am so interested in computer science. The field is so vast, that despite all the time I spend working on the topic, there always seem to be more to discover. Still, even though computers have proven able to hold my attention for the last several years, life always felt too short to focus on a single topic to me. Surfing, climbing, trekking, diy, photography, family, friends, are examples of other passions of mine.

# What is it ?

From time to time, I want to have a place to put notes; be it to discuss a topic with people, or just as a summary of a particular subject that I can share easily. I have tried three times to host a blog, but it never clicked under those past implementations. This time, I try a simpler approach, which I hope will make it easier to share my thoughts.

As for the content, there is no big plans for what I intend to put in here, but I expect it to be related to code, surfing, climbing or photography :)

Enjoy your stay on those pages!

Alex
